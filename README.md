### Syllabus for CS 5830

# Syllabus for CS 5830

Welcome to CS 5830, Cryptography. We will be studying cryptography, both the
theory and how it is used in practice. By the end of the course you should
understand the basics of cryptography, how cryptographers analyze the
security of cryptographic schemes, and how to implement suitable
cryptographic algorithms within broader projects. 

Classroom: Bloomberg Center 131

Instructor: Tom Ristenpart (https://rist.tech.cornell.edu)

Office hours: TBA

TAs: Yan Ji (yj348@cornell.edu), Senkath Menda (sm2289@cornell.edu)

TA Office hours: TBA

You will be invited to a class slack, which we will use for announcements, Q&A,
etc.  Contact Yan if you are having trouble getting onto it.

### Pre-requisites

Students should have programming experience (we will be focusing on Python),
understand basic probability, know binary representations (ASCII), operations on
bit strings (XOR), have some background on computer networking, file systems,
etc.  Equivalent of CS2800 (Discrete Mathematics) and comfort with reasoning
about algorithms, such as proving their correctness and analyzing their running
times, or permission of instructor.  The main skill that will be assumed is the
ability to understand and write formal mathematical definitions and proofs. It
is also important that you are familiar with basic probability (although we will
recall some basic concepts); please refresh yourself by reading Chapter 5 in the
following lecture notes: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rafael/discmath.pdf) If in
doubt talk to the instructors.

### Requirements

The class will involve a combination of lectures, in-class group exercises,
homeworks, a prelim, and a final. You'll be graded according to the following:

* Participation: 10%
* Homeworks:  60% (each homework will count an equal amount)
* Final:  30% 

There will be several opportunities for extra credit, as well. The current plan
is to have four homework assignments spread across the semester. Details and
schedule will be released in the first week of class. 


### One unit project

Those enrolling for an extra unit of credit will conduct a semester-long
project. We will provide example project ideas in the first two weeks of class,
and work with students to refine the projects. Projects could be a deep-dive
into some specific area of cryptography, an implementation project for some
state-of-the-art cryptography, or augmenting some other project of your interest
with cryptographic mechanisms. 

### Background reading and Lecture note

The following books should be helpful, but none are required if you don't want to spend the money:


* Portions of the course will take advantage of these lecture notes: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4830/2010fa/lecnotes.pdf
* [Cryptography 101 by Houtven](https://www.crypto101.io/). Free, but not complete. Feel free to send helpful feedback to the author.

* [Cryptography Engineering by Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno](https://www.schneier.com/books/cryptography_engineering/). A gentle
  introduction to cryptography.

* [Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html). A formal treatment of cryptography.
  We will make reference to, but not go into detail on, topics they treat in
  more detail.


## Lecture schedule

A very preliminary schedule is below to give a taste of the scope of
what we're hoping to cover.  
The lecture schedule is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CQtPZT0uAZuJ0WWg_TUXE1RvTmohK6_BM-T3mf_b4F4/edit?usp=sharing).
Lectures will be a mixture of remote (Zoom, check Canvas or Slack for the link)
and in-person.
